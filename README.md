My sensor sketches for MySensors: http://mysensors.org/

AM2320 - Sensor node for AM2320/AM2321 I2C temperature and humidity module
Also reports transmission failure as VAR_2

Counter - Testing node, increments a counter once a second as VAR_1, and reports transmission failures as VAR_2

EEPROM_read - Read EEPROM configuration for MySensor nodes
This is just for testing purposes, it is not an actual sensor node
